Background
----------

Vast majority of plasma physics is contained in the Vlasov-Maxwell
equations that describes the evolution of a particle distribution
:math:`f_s(t,\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})` function in 6D phase-space. The
particles move in electromagnetic fields that come from two sources:
(i) external coils and electrodes, and (ii) fields generated by the
motion of the particles themselves. This makes the problem highly
nonlinear: the fields tell the particles how to move, and the
particle motion itself modifies the fields.

.. math::

   \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial t}
   + \nabla_\mathbf{x} \cdot (\mathbf{v}f_s)
   + \nabla_\mathbf{v} \cdot (\mathbf{a}_s f_s)
   =
   \left( \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial t} \right)_c
	
where :math:`\mathbf{a}_s =
q_s/m_s(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B})` is the acceleration
due to Lorentz force on the particle and the right-hand side describes
the effect of collisions. Of course, the electromagnetic fields are
determined from Maxwell equations

.. math::

   \epsilon_0\mu_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
   - \nabla_\mathbf{x} \times \mathbf{B} &= -\mu_0
     \sum_s q_s \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} v f_s d\mathbf{v}^3 \\
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
   + \nabla_\mathbf{x} \times \mathbf{E} &= 0 \\
   \nabla_\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{E} &=
   \frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\sum_s q_s \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_s d\mathbf{v}^3 \\
   \nabla_\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{B} &= 0.

Suitable modifications are required to account for relativistic
effects.
   
Having written the basic equations it may appear that the field of
plasma physics is complete. However, this is far from the case. The
Vlasov-Maxwell system is a formidable system of coupled, nonlinear
equations and describes vast physics that spans an enormous range of
temporal and spatial scales. Everything from electron oscillations to
slow, resistive evolution of objects in near equilibrium is contained
within them. Hence, over the decades many approximations to the
Vlasov-Maxwell equations have been developed that are often more
tractable, allowing one to obtain reasonable results in specific
physical situations. Of course, the frontier in computational and
theoretical plasma physics remains the complete kinetic understanding
of plasma from the full Vlasov-Maxwell equations, and much of the
recent research focus has been on solving them (or asymptotic
approximations in strong magnetic fields) directly.

In this mini-course we will look at the key modern computational
techniques to handle various problems in plasma physics. This field
remains an active area of research, and in the recent years has
undergone a renaissance of sorts. My goal will be give you a flavor of
the methods and point out key literature in this field. In particular
we will study:

- Near first-principles simulations methods in which the
  Vlasov-Maxwell equation is solved using the
  finite-difference-time-domain particle-in-cell method (FDTD PIC).

- Solving fluid equations that are obtained from taking moments of the
  Vlasov-Maxwell equations and making a closure to approximate the
  moments not evolved by the fluid equations. Here we will study the
  modern approach based on the theory of hyperbolic PDEs and Riemann
  solvers. We will also look at the special requirements of solvers
  that are required to study fusion problems.

- Directly discretizing the Vlasov-Maxwell equations as a PDE in
  6D. This is an emerging area of active research and has applications
  to study of turbulence in fusion machines and also exploring
  fundamental plasma physics in phase-space.

Through these topics we will look at the general applied mathematics
literature for solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and
partial differential equations (PDEs), with emphasis of those
techniques that are useful in plasma physics.

Summary
=======

Read above introductory summary for overall background. It is
important to understand how to derive conservation and other
properties of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. Much of modern computational
plasma physics is focused on inventing schemes that preserve at least
some of these properties of the continuous system. See any plasma text
book or the following `excerpt
<./_static/Juno-et-al-JCP-2018-Proofs.pdf>`_ from [Juno2019]_ for
proofs.

The Big Picture
===============

To understand why computational methods have become central in plasma
physics we need to look at a few big-picture issues.

In particular:

- What are the cutting-edge research questions in computational plasma
  physics?

- What is the relationship between modern numerical methods and
  experiments and observations? (That is, why care about this stuff in
  the first place? Can simulations *predict* rather than *postdict*?)

- How to incorporate "real-world" effects into simulations? (For
  example, boundary conditions, atomic physics, etc)

One can look at computational physics in two ways: as an end in
itself, and as a tool for applications. Both of these are important!

As an end in itself:

- The first sits between applied mathematics and theoretical
  physics. The goal is to design efficient numerical methods to solve
  equations from theoretical physics.

- The goal here is the numerical method itself: what are its
  properties? Does it faithfully represent the underlying physics?
  Does it run efficiently on modern computers? Research into modern
  numerical methods (including structure preserving methods) fall into
  this category.

- Usually, besides the fun of solving complex equations (and writing
  code), the goal is to gain deeper understanding of underlying
  physics. **Some theoretical questions can only be answered with
  computer simulations.**

- This is a perfectly legitimate research area even if no connection
  to experiments is made, but only satisfies the curiosity of the
  researchers and helps one gain a better understanding of the
  physics.

As a tool for applications:

- The second is to look at the computational physics as providing
  tools to understand/design experiments or observations.

- Note that a large number of routine calculations are needed to build
  modern experiments (heat-transfer, structural analysis, basic fluid
  mechanics, equilibrium and stability calculations, etc). **Such
  routine calculations are no longer cutting edge research topics**.

At the intersection of cutting-edge computational physics and modern
plasma physics is a set of **Billion Dollar Questions**. (In general,
one should not put currency values to such things).

These **Billion Dollar Questions** need huge investments in
experimental and observational programs as well as the very latest in
computational physics research.

**Fusion Physics Examples: Building a working thermonuclear fusion reactor.**
#############################################################################

Nuclear reactors (both fission and fusion) are the only power-source
(besides fossil-fules) that can supply uninterupped and cheap
power. No working or prototype fusion power plant exists as of today.

- The `Iter project <https://www.iter.org>`_ aims to build the world's
  largest tokamak, a "magnetic bottle" to contain super-hot plasma and
  heat it to ignition temperatures.

There are other major fusion efforts around the world:

- `Beautiful stellarators <https://www.ipp.mpg.de/w7x>`_ (and `Wiki
  article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendelstein_7-X>`_) that may
  have better properties than tokamaks and provide a faster route to
  fusion energy

- `High-field based compact tokamaks
  <https://www.psfc.mit.edu/sparc>`_; `field-reversed configurations
  <https://tae.com>`_;

- Other alternate concepts: Field-reversed configurations (FRCs), both
  pulsed and continuous. (`TAE Technologies <https://tae.com/>`_,
  `Helion <https://www.helionenergy.com>`_)

- Plasma Mirrors: High-field mirrors (WHAM at U. Wisconsin) and
  rotating mirrors (U. Maryland).

- Z-pinches based concept: `ZEI <https://www.zapenergyinc.com/>`_

There are major unsolved problems in the basic physics of fusion
machines. Most of these can only be answered by large-scale computing
and much of the numerical tools have not yet been fully developed.

The `Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing
<https://www.scidac.org/partnerships/fusion-energy.html>`_ program in
fusion has large projects that address the very serious **Billion
Dollar Question**: will controlled fusion be eventually possible?

- The numerics research here is focused on gyrokinetic and even full
  kinetic understanding of fundamental turbulence and transport
  processes in the tokamak. **These equations are very difficult to
  solve!**

- Disruptions are dangerous processes that can "kill" certain fusion
  machine: large-scale MHD simulations are needed. Significant new
  research is being done in new numerical methods and application of
  existing MHD codes to such problems.

- Runaway electrons (relativistic high-energy electron beams) can
  drill holes in fusion machines. See `SCREAM project
  <https://scream.pppl.gov>`_ and `special PPCF issue
  <https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0741-3335/page/Special-Issue-on-Runaway-Electrons>`_.

- Very serious! **Will need huge kinetic calculations**. Also, the
  formulation of self-consistent coupling between the runaway electrons
  and MHD is not complete. See review by [Boozer2015]_.

**Space Physics Examples**
##########################


- `Paker Solar Probe
  <https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/parker-solar-probe>`_. "The
  primary science goals for the mission are to **trace how energy and
  heat move through the solar corona** and to explore **what
  accelerates the solar wind** as well as **solar energetic
  particles**."

- The Probe will collect detailed measurements of electric and
  magnetic fields as well as detailed distribution functions of
  particles.

- The solar wind plasma is nearly collisionless. It is likely that a
  proper understanding of kinetic physics (at the level of the
  Vlasov-Maxwell equations) will be needed to fully understand the
  physical processes.

- Cutting-edge simulations will be critical to this. Serious research
  into numerics of Vlasov-Maxwell needs to be done and very large
  simulations need to be run.

Many other missions are active and planned: `BepiColombo
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BepiColombo>`_ to Mercury; `Juno
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)>`_ to Jupiter.

- Much of the deep understanding of plasma processes in solar system
  planets (magnetospheres, ionosphere) can only be gained from
  detailed modeling: global kinetic modeling is likely
  impossible. **How to incorporate some kinetic effects into fluid
  models?**

**Extreme Plasma Astrophysics**
###############################

An emerging field of plasma physics is the study of the plasma
environment around compact astrophysical objects (neutron stars,
black-holes). See for example: http://kyleparfrey.org/

This is an extremely challenging field: need to incorporate General
Relativistic effects into plasma equations. Coupling between
gravitational effects and plasma leads to extremely energetic
events. releasing huge amounts of energy.

These are only selection of problems I am directly familiar with. I
hope it gives you a flavor and understanding why computational plasma
physics is such a serious and important field!

Lecture 2: Special ODE Integrators, FDTD Scheme
-----------------------------------------------

`PDF of Lecture 2 slides <./_static/lec2-2021.pdf>`_

Designing ODE solvers
=====================

The concept of phase-space volume preserving and symplectic schemes
can be more easily understood by looking at the example of a simple
harmonic oscillator

.. math::

   \frac{d^2z}{dt^2} = -\omega^2 z

where :math:`\omega` is the oscillation frequency.

To fully understand the physics behind these concepts one needs to
understand the *Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation* of
mechanics. For example, see text book of `Goldstein
<https://www.amazon.com/Classical-Mechanics-Pearson-New-International/dp/1292026553>`_
or first volume of `Landau and Lifshitz, Mechanics
<https://archive.org/details/Mechanics_541>`_. An overview of
Hamiltonian mechanics using *noncanonical coordinates* as applied to
single particle motion is given in Section II of [CaryBrizard2009]_.

A good description of various ODE solvers and their properties is
given in Chapter 2 of [DurranBook]_. Also `see
<https://gkeyll.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/ssp-rk.html>`_ for
formulas of the Strong-Stability preserving RK methods and their
stability regions.

Several ODE schemes have been designed to handle stiff sources and in
particular, diffusion terms arising from discretization of diffusion
equations. See [Abdulle2013]_ and also [Meyer2013]_ for description of
these schemes. In particular, the scheme by Meyer at al is to be
preferred to it superior stability properties.

The ODE solvers described above are low order, that is second or third
order. Some recent work attempts to construct very high order schemes
(10-15th order!) that essentially makes the issues of conservation and
other numerical errors mostly moot. For example, see [ReinSpiegel]_
for a 15th order scheme for use in gravitational N-body
simulations. Such very high-order schemes have not found use in
plasma-physics yet, mainly as the Maxwell solvers used in PIC codes
are mostly second-order anyway. However, it is possible that these
very high-order methods are useful in orbit codes.

Particles in an electromagnetic field, FDTD methods
===================================================

Particle-in-cell methods are based on pushing macro-particles. These
represent the motion of characteristics in phase-space, along which
the distribution function is conserved. The macro-particle
equations-of-motion are

.. math::

   \frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} &= \mathbf{v} \\
   \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} &= \frac{q}{m}(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B})

The most widely used method to solve this system of ODEs is the *Boris
algorithm*. See `this excerpt
<./_static/Birdsall-Landon-Boris-Push.pdf>`_ from Birdsall and Langdon
book for details on how to implement this efficiently.

The Boris algorithm is surprisingly good: it is a *second-order*,
*time-centered* method that *conserves phase-space volume*. However,
the error in phase-velocity (that is there is an error in time-period
of orbits) accumulates *linearly*, as we saw for the harmonic
oscillator. See [Qin2013]_ for proofs that the Boris algorithm is
*not* symplectic but conserves phase-space volume.

The relativistic Boris algorithm does not compute the correct
:math:`\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}` velocity. This can be corrected for
and still maintain the volume-preserving property and was done in
[HigueraCary2017]_.

The Yee-cell preserves the underlying geometric structure of Maxwell
equations, and ensures that the divergence relations are maintained in
the case of vacuum fields. In a plasma, however, current deposition
needs to be done carefully to ensure current continuity is
satisfied. See [Esirkepov2001]_, for example.

For extension of standard FDTD method to complex geometries, see, for
example [Nieter2009]_ and other references. Recent research has
focused on developing finite-element based PIC codes (that maintain
geometric structure of Maxwell equations), but these are usually very
expensive to run and very complex to develop.

Sometimes finite-volume schemes are also used to solve Maxwell
equations. These may have some advantages and disadvantages compared
to standard FDTD schemes. For example, FV usually do not conserve
energy and find it hard to satisfy divergence relations. For a
comparison of FV and FDTD methods see `this page
<http://ammar-hakim.org/sj/je/je6/je6-maxwell-solvers.html>`_.

A comprehensive review of structure preserving algorithms for use in
plasma physics is provided by [Morrison2017]_. It has numerous
references to the literature and should be consulted to develop a
detailed understanding of such schemes.
