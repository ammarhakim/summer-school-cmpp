Background
----------

Vast majority of plasma physics is contained in the Vlasov-Maxwell
equations that describes the evolution of a particle distribution
:math:`f_s(t,\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})` function in 6D phase-space. The
particles move in electromagnetic fields that come from two sources:
external coils and electrodes and the fields generated by the motion
of the particles themselves. This makes the problem highly nonlinear:
the fields tell the particles how to move, and the particles motion
itself modifies the fields.

.. math::

   \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial t}
   + \nabla_\mathbf{x} \cdot (\mathbf{v}f_s)
   + \nabla_\mathbf{v} \cdot (\mathbf{a}_s f_s)
   =
   \left( \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial t} \right)_c
	
where :math:`\mathbf{a}_s =
q_s/m_s(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B})` is the acceleration
due to Lorentz force on the particle and the right-hand side describes
the effect of collisions. Of course, the electromagnetic fields are
determined from Maxwell equations

.. math::

   \epsilon_0\mu_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
   - \nabla_\mathbf{x} \times \mathbf{B} &= -\mu_0
     \sum_s q_s \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} v f_s d\mathbf{v}^3 \\
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
   + \nabla_\mathbf{x} \times \mathbf{E} &= 0 \\
   \nabla_\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{E} &=
   \frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\sum_s q_s \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_s d\mathbf{v}^3 \\
   \nabla_\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{B} &= 0.

Suitable modifications are required to account for relativistic
effects.
   
Having written the basic equations it may appear that the field of
plasma physics is complete. However, this is far from the case. The
Vlasov-Maxwell system is a formidable system of coupled, nonlinear
equations and describes vast physics that spans an enormous range of
temporal and spatial scales. Everything from electron oscillations to
slow, resistive evolution of objects in near equilibrium is contained
within them. Hence, over the decades many approximations to the
Vlasov-Maxwell equations have been developed that are often more
tractable, allowing one to obtain reasonable results in specific
physical situations. Of course, the frontier in computational and
theoretical plasma physics remains the complete kinetic understanding
of plasma from the full Vlasov-Maxwell equations, and much of the
recent research focus has been on solving them (or asymptotic
approximations in strong magnetic fields) directly.

In this mini-course we will look at the key modern computational
techniques to handle various problems in plasma physics. This field
remains an active area of research, and in the recent years has
undergone a renaissance of sorts. My goal will be give you a flavor of
the methods and point out key literature in this field. In particular
we will study:

- Near first-principles simulations methods in which the
  Vlasov-Maxwell equation is solved directly. We will study two
  methods: the finite-difference-time-domain particle-in-cell method
  (FDTD PIC) (Lectures 1 and 2)

- Solving fluid equations that are obtained from taking moments of the
  Vlasov-Maxwell equations and making a closure to approximate the
  moments not evolved by the fluid equations. Here we will study the
  modern approach based on the theory of hyperbolic PDEs and Riemann
  solvers. We will also look at the special requirements of solvers
  that are required to study fusion problems (Lecture 3).

- Directly discretizing the Vlasov-Maxwell equations as a PDE in
  6D. This is an emerging area of active research and has applications
  to study of turbulence in fusion machines and also exploring
  fundamental plasma physics in phase-space. (Lecture 4)

Through these topics we will look at the general applied mathematics
literature for solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and
partial differential equations (PDEs), with emphasis of those
techniques that are useful in plasma physics.
  

Lecture 1: Single Particle Motion and Ordinary Differential Equations
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Read above introductory summary for overall background. It is
important to understand how to derive conservation and other
properties of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. Much of modern computational
plasma physics is focused on inventing schemes that preserve at least
some of these properties of the continuous system. See any plasma text
book or the following `excerpt
<./_static/Juno-et-al-JCP-2018-Proofs.pdf>`_ from [Juno2019]_ for
proofs.

Particle-in-cell methods are based on pushing macro-particles. These
represent the motion of characteristics in phase-space, along which
the distribution function is conserved. The macro-particle
equations-of-motion are

.. math::

   \frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} &= \mathbf{v} \\
   \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} &= \frac{q}{m}(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B})

The most widely used method to solve this system of ODEs is the *Boris
algorithm*. This is surprizingly good: it is a *second-order*,
*time-centered* method that *conserves phase-space volume*. However,
the error in phase-velocity (that is there is an error in time-period
of orbits) accumulates *linearly*. See [Qin2013]_ for proofs that the
Boris algorithm is *not* symplectic but conserves phase-space volume.
